            <!-- this is a paragraph about my early life -->
            <p> I was born on August 13, 2003 in <b>Pennsylvania</b>. I have lived there ever since in Aston. I started going to school at age 3 at St. Thomas the Apostle in Glen Mills. I went to that same school until I was 14 and now I go to Padua Academy which my older sister, Emma also went to. </p>
        
        
            <!-- this is a paragraph about my pets and hobbies -->
            <p> I have a pet dog named Winnie who is a golden doodle. She is very cute and cuddly but she is still just a puppy so she's a little crazy. I also have a guinea pig named Tod who chirps like a bird. I play soccer at Padua but I used to also play basketball and softball. Currently, I have a job at a retirement home where I am a waitress at a resteraunt. I take Art I because I like to draw but I'm not very creative. I also like to read, and currently I am reading my favorite book, <i>All The Light We Cannot See.</i></p>

        <p> <b>This is my favorite Walt Disney quote:</b> </p>
        
        <blockquote>"A person should set his goals as early as he can and devote all his energy and talent to getting there. With enough effort, he may achieve it. Or he may find something that is even more rewarding. But in the end, no matter what the outcome, he will know he has been alive."</blockquote>
